# Breast Cancer Detection with Topological Deep Learning

This repository accompanies our  paper, **"Breast Cancer Detection with Topological Deep Learning"**, which introduces a novel integration of topological data analysis (TDA) with convolutional and transformer-based deep learning architectures for improved breast cancer classification.

Our approach extracts topological descriptors—**Betti curves** and **persistence images**—and fuses them with image features using architectures including CNNs and Swin Transformers. This repository contains code for TDA feature extraction, deep learning model training, and reproducibility of our published results.

## Highlights
- **Betti-CNN** and **PI-CNN**: CNN architectures augmented with Betti curves and persistence images.
- **TopoSwin**: A novel architecture combining Swin Transformer features with Betti encodings via cross-attention.
- **Transformer-based Betti Encoder** for end-to-end topological representation learning.
- Benchmarked on real breast ultrasound datasets with superior performance over vanilla CNNs and standard transformers.
